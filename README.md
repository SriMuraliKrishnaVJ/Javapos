Hello guys! this is my program which is basically a terminal window program which takes in a phone number checks if it is a valid number and then opens up and shows different 
catogories in the store.
This is the basic gist of the program and has a manual mode by which you can add an item to your bill which is in the store by manually entering the values of the specific object .
This is just a small program for my 10th Grade Final project on Java for ICSE Board.
